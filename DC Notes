Device Contexts: 

A device context is a structure that defines a set of graphic objects and their associated attributes, as well as the graphic modes that affect output. 
The graphic objects include: 
a pen for line drawing 
a brush for painting and filling
a bitmap for copying or scrolling parts of the screen
a palette for defining the set of available colors
a region for clipping and other operations
a path for painting and drawing operations
