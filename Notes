<Device Contexts>: 

A device context is a structure that defines a set of graphic objects and their associated attributes, as well as the graphic modes that affect output. 
The graphic objects include: 
a pen for line drawing 
a brush for painting and filling
a bitmap for copying or scrolling parts of the screen
a palette for defining the set of available colors
a region for clipping and other operations
a path for painting and drawing operations

<GetWindowDC>
GetWindowDC is intended for special painting effects within a window's nonclient area. Painting in nonclient areas of any window is not recommended.
The GetSystemMetrics function can be used to retrieve the dimensions of various parts of the nonclient area, such as the title bar, menu, and scroll bars.
The GetDC function can be used to retrieve a device context for the entire screen.
After painting is complete, the ReleaseDC function must be called to release the device context. Not releasing the window device context has serious effects on painting requested by applications.
